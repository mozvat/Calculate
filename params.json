{"body":"### Welcome to the wonderful code that discovers the median from an array of numbers.\r\n\r\nRead the definition of the median here: [Wiki: Median-Definition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median)\r\n\r\n### Business rules for the Median calculation\r\n\r\n**1. Create an array of numbers**\r\n\r\n**2. Sort the array's values in ascending order**\r\n\r\n**3. Determine the middle array item**\r\n\r\n_* If, there is an odd number of array items, then simply get the middle item within the array and it's value is the median._\r\n\r\n_* If, there is an even number of array items, then find the middle two items within the array, add their values together, then divide by two to find the median._\r\n\r\n**4. Return the value of the middle array item**\r\n\r\n### Software Design\r\nI applied basic Single Responsibility principle ( [Wiki: Single Responsibility Definition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle) )design by modulating the calculation logic from the 'Main' Console posing as a User-Interface.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nContributors were Rob Hanson and myself. Feel free to extend the console window to read in values from the end user or print out more information during the varios business rules as they are completed.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nWish to be added as a contributor?
